"""Per-collector coverage — did we actually get to measure this? (issue #322)

A health tool must never let *"we couldn't measure this"* read as *"this is
fine."* Two collectors degrade silently on macOS, where the hub lacks the
privilege to read other users' data:

- **ports** — ``psutil.net_connections`` raises ``AccessDenied``, so the scan
  returns an empty list. Empty-because-denied and empty-because-nothing-listens
  are identical once stored, so this one signal is captured at collection time.
- **per-process memory / CPU** — ``memory_info``/``cpu_percent`` are denied for
  other users' processes, stored as NULL (never 0). Reconstructable after the
  fact by counting NULLs, so this is computed at finalize from the stored rows.

The result is a small map persisted on the run and surfaced in the report and
the verdict. Health and coverage are **orthogonal axes**: the verdict ``level``
stays the health of what we *could* measure; coverage rides alongside it. That
keeps a blind macOS run from being pinned at ``warning`` forever (the cry-wolf
failure #315 fought) while still refusing to call it a clean ``healthy``.

This module is the single source of the coverage vocabulary and of which
verdict rules depend on which collector, so the report, the rules, and the
export never drift apart.
