"""SQLite persistence for diagnostics captures (issue #315).

The repo's first SQLite store. ``data/diagnostics.db`` is gitignored runtime
state like everything else under ``data/``; the schema is versioned through
``PRAGMA user_version`` with a forward-only migration ladder so it can evolve
without hand-editing shipped tables.

Connection policy: one short-lived connection per operation, WAL journal. The
sampler writes once per tick (~15 s) and readers are user-driven, so pooling
would buy nothing and a long-lived handle across an asyncio task boundary is
a footgun. WAL keeps a reader from blocking the sampler's writes.

Every row carries the ``machine_id`` of the run that produced it, so DBs
copied off different machines merge cleanly for offline comparison.
