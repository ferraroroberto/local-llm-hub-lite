"""The on-demand capture loop (issue #315).

One asyncio task inside the already-running hub, alive only while a capture
is. That is the whole anti-bloat contract: when no run is active, this module
holds a ``None`` and costs nothing — no thread, no timer, no resident process.

A run samples every ``interval_s`` until ``duration_s`` elapses or it is
stopped. Sampling itself (psutil scans, ``nvidia-smi``, SQLite writes) is
blocking work, so each tick is dispatched with ``asyncio.to_thread`` and never
stalls the hub's request loop.

Only one run may be active at a time — concurrent captures would double the
observer effect and interleave confusingly in the store.
