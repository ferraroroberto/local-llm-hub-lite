"""Process → fleet-app attribution and the listening-port map (issue #315).

``python.exe × 14`` is noise. ``app-launcher: 3 procs / 800 MB`` is signal.
This module turns the former into the latter by reading each process's command
line and deciding which *app* owns it:

  1. **fleet root** — a path under a configured automation root
     (``E:/automation/<repo>/…``) attributes to ``<repo>``. This catches every
     sister project's ``.venv`` interpreter, which is how nearly all the
     fleet's Python processes actually launch.
  2. **known binary** — ``llama-server``, ``cloudflared``, ``dockerd``, browsers,
     OS services… mapped by executable name.
  3. **cmdline substring** — a few narrow rules for things neither of the above
     catches.
  4. **path prefix** — the broad net, matched last: an OS-owned directory
     (``/System/Library/``, ``/usr/libexec/``, ``C:/Windows/``) tells you the
     owner even when the executable's name means nothing on its own. This is
     what makes macOS and Linux legible (#320); enumerating Apple's several
     hundred daemon names by hand never would have been.
  5. **``unattributed``** — everything else. This bucket is not a failure mode;
     it is the review list of processes nobody has accounted for yet, which is
     precisely what the user is trying to find.

Rules live in ``config/diagnostics_apps.json`` so teaching the sampler a new
app is a data edit, never a code change. Any rule group may additionally carry
a ``_windows`` / ``_darwin`` / ``_linux`` suffixed twin, merged in only on that
platform — ``/usr/bin`` is Apple-owned on macOS but ordinary user software on
Linux, so a single cross-platform table cannot be right for both.
