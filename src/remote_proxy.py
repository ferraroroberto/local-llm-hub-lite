"""Resolve the base URL of a model's *owning* host when it's not this one.

A model row can declare ``host: <host-id>`` (see ``Model.host`` in
``src/model_registry.py``) to mark which host spawns/manages its process.
When the active host is a *different* one, requests for that model must be
forwarded to the owning host's own hub instead of dispatched locally. This
module is the single place that turns "which host owns this model" into
"what URL do I forward to" — every dispatch path (chat, audio, admin model
control) shares it rather than re-deriving the address.
