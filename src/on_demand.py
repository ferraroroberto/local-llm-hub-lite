"""On-demand model lifecycle — spawn on first request, unload when idle (#422).

A ``models.yaml`` row may declare ``startup: on_demand`` (default ``eager``,
the always-on behavior). Such a row is never started eagerly — hub
autostart (``model_registry.desired_model_ids``) excludes it. Instead:

* **Load on first request** — the dispatch paths that reach a local backend
  (chat completions, the Anthropic-shape ``/v1/messages`` translation, and
  the audio proxy) call :func:`ensure_ready` before forwarding. When the
  backend isn't up, the request spawns it via ``backend_process.start`` and
  blocks polling ``is_reachable`` until the process answers.
* **Idle unload** — ``idle_unload_minutes: <int>`` arms the watchdog loop
  (``server_lifecycle`` wires :func:`idle_unload_loop`): after that many
  minutes without a request the hub stops the backend. A model stopped this
  way (or by hand via the admin API) stays down.
* **VRAM budget warning, not arbitration** — before an on-demand spawn, the
  sum of the running local models' ``est_vram_mb`` plus the candidate's is
  checked against the host's ``vram_mb`` ceiling (#375 grid math). Overcommit
  logs a loud warning and proceeds: WDDM overcommit degrades transiently and
  idle unload recovers it. Eviction arbitration is explicitly out of scope.

State is process-local and in-memory (last-request timestamps, in-flight
request counts) — an unload decision never outlives the hub that made it.
