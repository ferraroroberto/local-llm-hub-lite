"""Windows Job Object containment for hub subprocesses (#468).

The single implementation of "assign a child to a job that kills its whole
membership when the last handle closes". Caller: ``tests/e2e``'s
``hub_url`` fixture, containing a throwaway test hub and every backend it
spawns — the incident this module was written for, below.

A verification run (``tests/e2e``'s ``hub_url`` fixture) boots a throwaway
hub as a plain ``subprocess.Popen``. If a test drives an ``on_demand``
backend row (``src.backend_process.start``), that backend is spawned with
``CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP`` (see ``server_process.WIN_NEW_GROUP``) —
deliberately detached so ``CTRL_BREAK_EVENT`` aimed at the hub during its
own polite shutdown doesn't propagate to it. That's correct for the
*primary* checkout, where a backend surviving a hub restart is the intended
behaviour (``inherit_running_backends``). It's wrong for a throwaway test
hub: the fixture's teardown only ``proc.terminate()``s the hub PID itself,
which never reaches a grandchild in a different process group, so the
backend outlives the hub that spawned it and pins the worktree it's
rooted in (#468).

A Windows Job Object fixes this without caring about process-group
boundaries: assigning the hub's ``Popen`` to a job created with
``JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE`` automatically pulls in every future
descendant (subprocess creation joins the creator's job unless it opts out
with ``CREATE_BREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB``, which nothing here does). Two distinct
guarantees fall out of that one flag:

* :func:`terminate_and_close` kills every *current* member of the job, even
  ones whose immediate parent already exited — exactly the observed
  incident (the hub PID's parent was gone, the grandchild wasn't). Call
  it from the fixture's ``finally:`` block.
* If the process holding the job handle (the test harness itself) is
  killed before reaching that ``finally:``, Windows closes its handles for
  it — including the job handle — which fires ``KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE`` and
  reaps every member with no application code needing to run at all. This
  is what survives the spawner being killed mid-run, not just a clean exit.

No-op (returns ``None`` / ``False``) on non-Windows and on any API failure
— containment is best-effort so a broken job object never blocks a test
run from booting or tearing down its hub.
