"""Fleet machine console (#309) — the data layer behind the Machines tab.

Turns the host inventory (``host_profile.all_hosts()``) into a per-machine
view for the admin SPA, with the **same** CPU/RAM/GPU/disk/uptime snapshot on
every machine and a liveness signal that reflects *is the box powered on* —
not whether the hub happens to run there:

  * the **current machine** snapshots ``system_stats`` locally
    (:func:`self_snapshot`, also served at ``/admin/api/machines/self``);
  * a **peer** is liveness-probed by a hub-independent TCP connect
    (``remote_stats.is_reachable``) and, when up, gives the same snapshot over
    the hub user's own SSH (``remote_stats.collect``);
  * a **dormant** node (a powered-down box, if any is flagged) is shown
    but never live-probed.

Power actions (reboot/shutdown) live in ``remote_bootstrap`` and run over the
hub user's own general SSH (#311); this module only computes *which* actions
each machine may offer. The active hub host never offers reboot/shutdown —
the destructive action the whole design excludes.
