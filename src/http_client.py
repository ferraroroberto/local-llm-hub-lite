"""Shared, pooled ``httpx`` clients for the hub.

Constructing an ``httpx.Client`` / ``httpx.AsyncClient`` is **expensive** —
each construction builds an SSL context and a fresh connection pool. On the
reference Windows box that measured ~0.26 s *per construction*, independent of
the request itself (a reused client answers a loopback call in ~1 ms). The hub
used to build a new client on every proxied / upstream call, so every request
paid that ~0.26 s tax on top of the actual work (issue #165; #163 fixed the
TTS-speech path first).

These module-level singletons are built once and reused for the lifetime of
the process, so each call pays ~1 ms instead. Both are created lazily — the
async one binds whatever event loop is running on first use — and closed on hub
shutdown via :func:`aclose` / :func:`close`.

Per-call timeouts differ widely (a 2 s health probe vs a 900 s image
generation), so the clients carry a single generous default and callers pass
the real timeout via the request's ``timeout=`` argument (httpx applies it
per-request). Do **not** close the shared client inside a request handler.

Backends that run in their *own* process (the Orpheus engine and the
whisper-vanilla shim live outside the hub process) can't use these — they hold
their own persistent client in their own process.
