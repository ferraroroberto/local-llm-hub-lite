"""CORS policy for browser-based clients (#462).

Without CORS headers a page's JavaScript cannot call the hub at all: the
preflight fails and the ``fetch`` never reaches a route, so every sister
webapp on this machine has to proxy through its own backend to talk to a
loopback service. This module is the whole policy — which origins may
call, which request headers they may send, and which response headers
they may *read* (a header a browser cannot read is the same as not
sending it).

Three deliberate choices, each of which is the security-relevant half:

- **Origins are never a wildcard.** Loopback origins are allowed
  unconditionally via :data:`LOOPBACK_ORIGIN_REGEX`; anything else has to
  be named in ``cors_allow_origins`` in ``config/webapp_config.json``. A
  ``"*"`` found in that list is dropped with a warning rather than
  honoured — ``allow_origins=["*"]`` is exactly the shape that turns a
  loopback-trusting service into one any page in the browser can drive.
- **Loopback is the default because it is already the trust boundary.**
  The bearer gate (``src/auth_middleware.py``) lets a loopback caller
  through without a token, so letting a loopback *origin* read the
  response grants nothing it did not already have. A page served from a
  non-loopback origin still makes its request from 127.0.0.1 — so the
  origin check, not the client IP, is what keeps it from reading the
  answer.
- **Credentials are off.** The hub sets no cookies and uses no
  HTTP-auth realm; it authenticates from ``Authorization`` / ``x-api-key``
  / ``?token=``, which a plain (non-credentialed) cross-origin ``fetch``
  carries fine. Leaving ``allow_credentials`` off removes the
  credentialed-CORS risk class outright instead of relying on the origin
  list to contain it.

CORS is **not** an auth relaxation: the middleware is installed
outermost so a preflight ``OPTIONS`` is answered instead of 401'd, but a
real request still travels the full stack and meets the bearer gate
exactly as before.
