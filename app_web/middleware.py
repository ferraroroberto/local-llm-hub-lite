"""Bearer-token middleware for the /admin sub-app.

Loopback callers (PC itself) bypass the bearer token. Non-loopback
callers must present ``Authorization: Bearer <token>``, ``x-api-key:
<token>`` (the Anthropic SDK's own credential header, #461), or
``?token=…`` on the URL (the last is what bookmarked / shared
URLs use; the SPA strips it from ``window.location`` on first load).

WebSocket handshakes are not seen by this middleware:
``BaseHTTPMiddleware`` only ever runs for ``http``-scope connections, so
a ``@router.websocket(...)`` route would get no coverage from it at all.
This app has no websocket routes — every live-ops stream uses SSE
(plain HTTP, covered here); any future websocket route must implement
its own guard before ``accept()``.
