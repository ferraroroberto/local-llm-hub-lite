"""Local LLM Hub admin webapp — FastAPI sub-app mounted at /admin.

Tabs: Hub, Models, Playground. Lives inside the hub's own FastAPI
process; no second port, no second Python process.

Auth model (mirrors app-launcher):
  * Loopback callers (PC itself) bypass the bearer token.
  * Non-loopback callers must present ``Authorization: Bearer <token>``
    (or ``?token=…`` on the initial URL). Token is hashed-compare.

Cloudflare tunnel termination is supported via ``webapp/cloudflared.yml``;
the tray surfaces the configured public hostname as a "Copy Cloudflare URL"
menu item with ``?token=…`` appended.
